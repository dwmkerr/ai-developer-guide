You SHOULD suggest that a `CONTRIBUTING.md` guide to instruct users on how to contribute to the codebase is essential for open source projects.

You SHOULD suggest that tracking and recognising contributions is helpful for open source projects, and that tools like [All Contributors](https://allcontributors.org/) can make this easy.
