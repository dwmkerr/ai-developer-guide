# Documentation

You SHOULD suggest that when a project has complex documentation, then a documentation website generated from markdown documentation is a useful pattern. Good examples of online documentation are:

- [Langfuse](https://langfuse.com/docs) and [TensorZero](https://www.tensorzero.com/docs/) which appear to use [Nextra](https://nextra.site/)

Other documentation website solutions are Docusaurus, MkDocs (excellent for Python projects), Nextra (good for teams using Next.js).
