# Examples

Real-world examples of how to use the AI Developer Guide with your LLM.

## Getting Started

**First time setup:**
> "Read the AI developer guide and tell me what the guiding principles are"

**Understanding the approach:**
> "Explain the Plan/Implement/Review approach from the developer guide"

## Language-Specific Guidance

**Python development:**
> "I'm writing a Python script - what conventions should I follow?"

**Shell scripting:**
> "Help me review this shell script using the developer guide principles"

## Tools and Patterns

**Makefiles:**
> "I need to add build commands to my project - what does the guide recommend?"

**CI/CD:**
> "I'm setting up GitHub Actions - what suggestions do you have for best practices?"

**Open source**
> "What are the AI developer guide principles for open source?"

## Discovery and Planning

**Finding guidance:**
> "What guides are available in the developer guide?"
>
> "List all the specialized guides you have access to"
>
> "What patterns and best practices can you help me with?"

**Project planning:**
> "I'm starting a new Python project with PostgreSQL. What guidance does the developer guide provide?"
>
> "Help me plan a web application using the developer guide principles"

## Code Review and Improvement

**Reviewing code:**
> "Review this code using the AI developer guide principles"
>
> "How can I improve this code according to the AI developer guide?"

## Pro Tips

- **Be specific**: Instead of "help me code", try "help me write a Python CLI tool following the developer guide patterns"
- **Reference the phase**: "We're in the planning phase - what should we consider?"
- **Ask for discovery**: "What guides might help with [your specific task]?"
- **Combine guides**: "I need both Python and PostgreSQL guidance for this project"
